CtrlPaint 101 series

# Writeup

While starting Drawabox, I learned about the 50% rule, in which half of your art time needs to be dedicated to fun, non-tutorial projects. I had definitely not been following this. I decided that I wanted to do digital painting for my 50% rule, so I went through the 101 series on CtrlPaint to learn the basics. After completing Drawabox, I will go through the rest of the CtrlPaint series, but for now this should be enough to obey the 50% rule. 

The only exercise here that isn't incoherent scribbling to learn the tools is the Blending Worksheet, so I have uploaded it here. 

The JPG file is the sample one given to us. The PSD is my actual work.
